# data.txt

Consists of:
1. The date of the first day in YYYY-MM-DD format
2. Multiple lines of data

The data consists of comma separated values.
Each value corresponds to an hour in the local time zone, which may be associated with zero or more activities.
Activites are denoted with a specific character (see categories-info.txt).
"_" is for hours with 0 activities (due to moving through time zones etc.)
"+" is used to join activities for hours with multiple activities (due to moving through time zones etc.)

# analyse-data.py

    * convert activities to categories using the mapping in categories.txt
    * count the occurrence of each category in each day

    * normalise each day to sum to 1
    * apply cumulative sum (in reverse)
The output is ready to be used by js/main.js.
